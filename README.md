# Data-Science-Final-Project
# Prediction-Text-Model

Now a days people are spending an increasing time on their mobile devices. But typing on mobile devices can be a serious pain sometimes. 'Swift key', our corporate partner in this capstone, builds a smart keyboard to make the typing easier. One corner stone of their smart keyboard is 'predictive text models'.
By using some basic Natural Language Processing (NLP), and the knowledge aquired from data science specialization courses, here we built a predictive model algorithm to predict the next word.

To complete this project we performed 8 tasks:

Understanding the problem, Data acquisition and cleaning, Exploratory analysis, Statistical modeling, Predictive modeling, Creative exploration, Creating a data product and Creating a short slide deck pitching.

# Shiny App: https://captainwoman.shinyapps.io/DS_Final/

The goal of the project is to build a predictive text model. The model will be implemented with a shiny app UI that will predict the next word as the user types a sentence.
